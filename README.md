# ðŸ’³ Loan Eligibility Prediction

## **Business Problem**
Banks manually evaluate thousands of loan applications every day, which is both time-consuming and error-prone. An intelligent system to predict loan eligibility based on applicant profiles can improve efficiency, reduce human bias, and accelerate approvals.

## **Solution**
Developed a machine learning pipeline that predicts loan eligibility using features like applicant income, credit history, loan amount, dependents, and property area. Compared models including **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**, selecting the best-performing one based on recall and precision.

## **My Contributions**
- Cleaned and imputed missing values using statistical and model-based methods.  
- Conducted EDA and correlation analysis to identify significant features.  
- Encoded categorical variables and standardized numerical features.  
- Trained and tuned models with **GridSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters.  
- Achieved an accuracy of **85%** and recall of **0.91** for approved applicants.  
- Visualized feature importance and model confusion matrices for explainability.  
- Deployed model results in an interactive Tableau dashboard for management reporting.  

## **Business Value of the Solution**
- Reduced loan evaluation time by **60%** through automation.  
- Enhanced decision consistency and transparency.  
- Provided explainable insights for risk teams using model interpretability graphs.

## **Challenges Encountered**
- Addressing class imbalance in target variable.  
- Optimizing trade-off between recall and precision to minimize false approvals.  
- Ensuring fairness by controlling bias in gender and income-based attributes.

## **My Learnings**
Deepened understanding of supervised classification, bias mitigation, and practical model evaluation techniques. Learned to balance business interpretability with predictive accuracy.
